## Overview
This repository contains Top King, a classic chess game that offers single and multiplayer modes. The project is built using JavaScript and HTML. This project was developed by a group of volunteers who are both passionate about coding and chess. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Our Mission and Importance
The game of chess has been developing alongside culture and technology for over 1,400 years. Since the 1990's we have seen a boom in technical innovations related to chess. When Deep Blue, a chess computer built by IBM, defeated the reigning World Chess Champion, it showed the world the coming influence of artificial intelligence and maching learning. 

Our innovations to the game of chess, will create a new platform where gaming can be more than a past-time. It can be an act of charity, a source of income, and way to exchange culture and learn.

### Mission Statement
Spread our love for chess, blockchain, and cultural diversity to our users. To provide financial inclusion and access to education to our users, and never charge for it. We are commited to sustainability, security of our users, and decentralized finance/education. We are and always will be, "for the people by the people".

All members of our development team are volunteers, who believe in our mission, goals, and vision. Our development team is commited to maintaining our open source software.
